## Ian Fleming

I am a driven and ambitious Full Stack Junior Developer looking for a role where I can continue to hone my skills as a developer while contributing to the success of the company. I am currently enrolled on a 12 week long intensive software development course with Makers Academy. 

As a creative, I am excited by prospect of using my imagination to work on truly exciting things within the tech world.

## Experience

**Self Employed** (Sep '18 - Present)  
_Musician_

- For the last 2 years, I have been able to successfully support myself entirely through self employed income, and was even able to adapt to Covid-19 restrictions by moving all of my work online. There are 2 sides to my work as a self employed musican. The first is teaching piano and music theory, which I have done for students ranging from 3 years old up to adult age. The second is composition, where I have composed music for several award winning pieces of theatre and had my music performed in world famous music venues by highly reputable musical ensembles.

## Skills

Consider skills relevent to software development. Then consider your best skills. Pick 2-4 skills and write a short descriptive paragraph for each one. You should demonstrate how capable you are at this skill with examples.

#### Fast learner

throughout my life, I have demonstrated many times that I am capable of learning new and difficult skills at a very fast rate. For example, I was able to achieve a distinction in grade 8 piano only 3 years after taking up the instrument. Additionally, through self teaching, I have also succeeded in learning several computer softwares from scratch to a professional standard, including Pro Tools, Sibelius, Adobe Premiere Pro and Opentoonz. This includes the ability to work out and resolve any issues that I have faced with these programmes.
