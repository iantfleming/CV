## Ian Fleming

I am a driven and ambitious **Full Stack Junior Developer** looking for a role where I can continue to hone my skills while contributing to the success of the company. I have recently completed a 16 week long intensive software development course with Makers Academy.

After graduating from Newcastle University with a degree in music, I spent 4 years working as a special educational needs teaching assistant and freelance composer and piano teacher. In the last 2 years I have focused exclusively on composition and teaching. Along with my work in music education, I have also performed in and written for several successful plays and performed around the country.

I am excited by the scale of opportunites that a tech role has to offer and look forward to being given the chance to put my newfound skills to use in a novel environment.

## Experience

_Musician_

- For the last 2 years, I have been able to successfully support myself entirely through self employed income, and was even able to adapt to Covid-19 restrictions by moving all of my work online. There are 2 sides to my work as a self employed musican. The first is teaching piano and music theory, which I have done for students ranging from 3 years old all the way up to adult age. The second is composition, where I have composed music for several award winning pieces of theatre and had my music performed in world famous music venues by highly reputable musical ensembles.
