## Ian Fleming

I am a driven and ambitious **Full Stack Junior Developer** looking for a role where I can continue to hone my skills while contributing to the success of the company. I have recently completed a 16 week long intensive software development course with Makers Academy.

After graduating from Newcastle University with a degree in music, I spent 4 years working as a special educational needs teaching assistant and freelance composer and piano teacher. In the last 2 years I have focused exclusively on composition and teaching. Along with my work in music education, I have also performed in and written for several successful plays and performed around the country.

I am excited by the scale of opportunites that a tech role has to offer and look forward to being given the chance to put my newfound skills to use in a novel environment.

## Experience

**Self Employed** / (Sep '18 - Present)  
_Musician_

For the last 2 years, I have been able to successfully support myself entirely through self employed income, and was even able to adapt to Covid-19 restrictions by moving all of my work online. There are 2 sides to my work as a self employed musican. The first is teaching piano and music theory, which I have done for students ranging from 3 years old all the way up to adult age. The second is composition, where I have composed music for several award winning pieces of theatre and had my music performed in world famous music venues by highly reputable musical ensembles.

**St Mary & St Michael Catholic Primary School** / (Oct '16 - Jul '18)  
_Special Educational Needs Teaching Assistant_

Before becoming a freelance musician full time, I worked as a teaching assistant for a student with special educational needs. This role involved many responsibilities, both in helping the student I worked 1-1 with, and serving the school's wider needs. One of my responsibilities was to help to develop strategies for preparing the student I worked with for his year 6 SAT's as much as possible. I would also be in charge of dealing with the behaviour of the student which at times could be volatile. On a larger scale, the school would trust me with ensuring the safety of students while on school trips, involving the following of strict procedures to ensure there were no safety breaches. 

## Skills

Consider skills relevent to software development. Then consider your best skills. Pick 2-4 skills and write a short descriptive paragraph for each one. You should demonstrate how capable you are at this skill with examples.

#### Thrives under pressure
Completing all 16 weeks of Makers Academy, while still working in the evenings put me under a considerable amount of pressure which I was able to overcome and produce excellent work alongside members of various teams I was a part of which can be viewed on my [GitHub](https://github.com/iantfleming) account.

Whilst taking a gap year from 2010-11, I was able to complete ABRSM grade 8 piano with a distinction and a merit in ABRSM grade 8 music theory. This helped me to receive a place at Newcastle University. At the same time I was doing this, I was also writing the score to a full 2 act musical which went on to raise over Â£600 for a cancer charity.

#### Fast learner

Throughout my life, I have demonstrated that I am capable of learning new and difficult skills at an impressive speed. Joining Makers Academy and learning several coding languages to a proficient level, including Ruby and Javascript in only 16 weeks demonstrates one of many examples. Additionally, I took only 3 years after to accomplish grade 8 in piano from having no experience of the instrument at all. Through self teaching, I have also succeeded in learning several computer softwares from scratch to a professional standard, including Pro Tools, Sibelius, Adobe Premiere Pro and Opentoonz. 

#### Determined

While at Makers I was always determined not only to get the most I possibly could out of the course, but also to complete all work to the highest standard I could, including group projects and solo projects. For the final 2 weeks at Makers, we were given the opportunity to create our own apps from scratch. Much of the apps functionality could have been implemented using Ruby, HTML and CSS. However, this would not have given us the exact results that we wished for, so instead, we decided as a group to use JavaScript, and more importantly, React, which we as a group were all much less familiar with. Using both of these allowed us to create much more dynamic and interesting web pages, giving us the effect we were looking for. My group and I were determined to make the app as close to our vision as possible, even if it meant challenging ourselves in what was a very short time frame for such an ambitious project.

#### Adaptable
Just before the first British lockdown took place in March 2020, my main source of income was in person piano lessons which would soon be disallowed under lockdown rules. Thinking on my feet, I was quickly able to work out a plan to move all of my teaching online, which worked to considerable success. Since lockdown began, I have tutored 3 students through their ABRSM piano exams, including one student who was able to pass ABRSM grade 7. Another example of my adaptability comes from my time at Makers Academy. Not only did I have to adapt to pair programming with a new person every day, when work in groups, both teams decided to elect a new leader every day. Being selected for the leadership role required group decision making such as who would work together, and what the aims of the day would be. Despite taking on the role at short notice I was easily able to guide my group through a successful days work. The high quality of our final products are testament to this fact.
